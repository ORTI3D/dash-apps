# Dash Groundwater monitoring data - Visualisation & Interpretation

This is a Dash interactive Python framework developed to visualising and interpreting groundwater monitoring data.

## Getting Started

#### Running the app locally

First create a virtual environment with conda or venv inside a temp folder, then activate it.

`conda create --name myenv`

`conda activate myenv`

Clone the git repo, then install the requirements with pip

`git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-apps`

`cd dash-apps/dash-ssp`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the app

`python app.py`



## About the app

The app is in development. The first example is based on the demo of dash developed by plotly named "dash-oil-and-gas", see https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/master/apps/dash-oil-and-gas.

This dash app will be a multi-page dashbord with graphs and maps for the visualisation and interpretation of groundwater monitoring data.
